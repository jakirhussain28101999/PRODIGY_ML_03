# PRODIGY_ML_03
Implement a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.
<br>
Dataset:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chetankv/dogs-cats-images
<br>
I have used 500 sample images per category, and 80% of them for training. <br> Accuracy can be increased by increasing dataset containing thousands of images and number of relevant tokens.
<br>
<br>
t1.jpeg - t4.jpeg are the images I used to check output.
